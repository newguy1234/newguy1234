Hi :)

My name is Petru-Mihai Craciun but you can call me Petru, thanks for taking a gander at my code.

I am currently a student studying a Intergrated Masters in Artifical inteligence.

My reposotories will contain code that I either have made on the side or have done at university,
sorry if sometimes the variables are really annoying to understand doing long coding sesh's makes
my brain puke out some random variable names :/....

Hope you enjoy the code and you have all rights to use it and copy it into your own code ;)
